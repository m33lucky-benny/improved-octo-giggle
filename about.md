    <h1 class="about-heading">Hi, I'm Kieron 👋</h1>
    
    <p class="about-intro">
      I'm a gamer first, entrepreneur second. KieronPlay started because I was tired of sketchy top-up sites, 
      slow delivery, and getting scammed trying to buy Valorant Points at 2 AM. So I built something better.
    </p>

    <h2>My Gaming Journey</h2>
    
    <p>
      Like many of you, I've been gaming since I could hold a controller. These days, you'll find me 
      grinding ranked matches in <strong>Valorant</strong> (Immortal rank, don't ask how many hours), 
      or exploring the stunning open world of <strong>Where Wind Meets</strong> when I need to unwind.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've played everything from Mobile Legends to Genshin Impact, PUBG Mobile to Free Fire.
      I know what it's like to need those diamonds <em>right now</em> for a limited skin, or to top up
      at the last minute before a season ends. I've been there. I've felt that frustration.
    </p>

    <p>
      That's why I started KieronPlay—to create the game credits platform I wish existed when I was
      getting started in gaming.
    </p>

  <section class="about-section">
    <h2>Why I Built KieronPlay</h2>
    
    <p>
      The game top-up industry is full of middlemen, delays, and trust issues. I got scammed more times 
      than I'd like to admit buying UC and diamonds from random sellers. One time, I waited 48 hours for 
      a top-up that never came. Another time, my account got flagged because of suspicious transactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Enough was enough.</strong> As a developer and a gamer, I knew I could build something better.
      Something transparent, instant, and trustworthy. A platform where gamers could top up without worry,
      get their credits immediately, and actually get customer support when things went wrong.
    </p>

    <p>
      KieronPlay isn't run by suits who've never played a game. It's built by someone who understands
      the frustration of running out of credits mid-battle pass, or missing a limited-time shop rotation
      because your top-up is "processing."

    <h2>Currently Playing</h2>
    
    <p>
      When I'm not working on KieronPlay, you can catch me:
    </p>

    <ul class="game-list">
      <li><strong>Valorant:</strong> Maining Chamber and Jett. Always looking for queue partners who comm properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Where Wind Meets:</strong> Exploring the martial arts world, perfecting my parry timing, and taking way too many screenshots.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile Legends:</strong> Casual matches with friends. I'm terrible at jungle role but decent at support.</li>
      <li><strong>Genshin Impact:</strong> Daily commissions slave, still haven't gotten the 5-star I want from standard banner.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="fun-fact">
      <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I've spent more on game credits in the past year than I'd like to admit.
      At least now those purchases help me understand what features to build into KieronPlay. 😅

    <h2>The Team (It's Small!)</h2>
    
    <p>
      Right now, KieronPlay is a small operation. It's me handling development, customer support, 
      and most operations, with a few trusted friends helping out during peak hours. We're not trying 
      to be the biggest platform—we're trying to be the <em>best</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every customer matters. Every transaction matters. And yeah, I personally check the support tickets
      because I care about getting things right. Maybe that doesn't scale, but it's how we roll for now.
    </p>
